<h1>Welcome to my site</h1>

<p>Hello. This is the site of Gaurav Rao. The purpose of this site is to host the many projects that I do. Currently, I am working on my php, html, css, javascript, and jquery programming skills. I am used to programming in Java, but that is a bit too heavy for a basic website. Anyway, I am also interested in Math, solving twisty puzzles, and many other things. Contact me at wizgrao@gmail.com</p>
